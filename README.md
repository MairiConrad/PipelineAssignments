# Pipeline Assignments

In this repository, I will be uploading my final assignments for Applied Data Science. 

My [Pycaret](https://pycaret.org/) pipeline is a great example of what happens when you are analyzing too small of a sample size against a large dataset. I analyze and try to predict movies that my grandmother would buy based on her current collection of movies against the [IMDB dataset](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/) of feature films specifically.

My [Yellowbrick](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/index.html) pipeline is analyzing a built in dataset from seaborn that I used previously for my visualization assignment that is looking at the miles per gallon of cars and trying to predict the miles per gallon. I followed the pipeline's covered in class over several classes beginning April 4th.
